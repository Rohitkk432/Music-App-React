1. At the start of the project i only knew how to use HTML, CSS, JS. but during the project i learned PostgreSQL , express(basics), APIs, HTTP requests, Postman, ReactJS.
2. I learnt how to deploy website on netlify(i used for client-side) and heroku(i used for server-side).
3. Faced many issues with google login and atlast resorted to use React Library for it.
4. i didnt know in the start of project how to use database , that we have to deploy server and client seperately, that there is even a server side but now i have learnt about it.
